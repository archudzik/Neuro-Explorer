How to utilize this Setup Kit to get started
============================================

1. Carefully read the MWM2 Quick Start Guide (QSG) and follow the step-by-step instructions to pair your MindWave Mobile 2 headset with your computer.

2. IMPORTANT!: Double-click the "MWM Tutorial.exe" (located in the "MindWave Mobile Tutorial" folder) to run the Tutorial app, and then follow the on-screen instruction to set up the headset and set it into the correct mode according to your region. (NOTE: Whenever you travel to a different region, remember to use this Tutorial app again to reconfigure the headset.)

3. Besides the MindWave Mobile Tutorial app, there are many applications available on the NeuroSky Online Store (https://store.neurosky.com/collections/apps), but many of them will require the ThinkGear Connector (TGC) in order to be able to communicate with the MindWave Mobile 2 headset.  Therefore, be sure to run the "ThinkGear Connector.exe" in the "ThinkGear Connector" folder to install TGC.

4. If you would like to obtain more information about NeuroSky technology and how the MindWave Mobile 2 headset works, please feel free to read the MWM2 User Guide in this Setup Kit.

And most of all, enjoy!
